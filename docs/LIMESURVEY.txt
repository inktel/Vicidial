LIME SURVEY and ViciDial

We've been asked about Lime Survey(http://www.limesurvey.org) integration with ViciDial several times so here is a little summary of how you install it as well as how you can get it to work with Vicidial.

We recommend creating a LimeSurvey Survey for each campaign and adding a "question" that will store the lead ID or phone number. For example, we will use the code LEADID to the survey and then we will send those variables using the web form in the agent interface using the following for the web form address:
VARhttp://SERVER/limesurvey/index.php?sid=37487&lang=en&37487X1X5=--A--phone_number--B--
   (example: http://SERVER/limesurvey/index.php?sid=37487&lang=en&37487X1X5=3125551212)
	37487 is the survey ID
	1 is the question group ID
	5 is the question ID (phone number)
	3125551212 is a phone number
