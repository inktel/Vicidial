VICIDIAL and Vtiger

Current VICIDIAL integration with Vtiger is for the 5.1.0 release version of Vtiger only (we also have support for older Vtiger 5.0.4)

Current integration features:
- vicidial.php WEBFORM search for lead/account/vendor
- User synchronization of VICIDIAL users to Vtiger user database
- User Group synchronization of VICIDIAL user groups to Vtiger Groups
- Added activity event option(call logging in Vtiger) when going from VICIDIAL to Vtiger
   (Or this can be done in the background without having to use the web form)
- Added ViciDial status synchronization after each call to set the siccode field in Vtiger to the last selected VICIDIAL status
- Ability to un-delete or resurrect deleted Accounts within Vtiger from the web form(this is a VICIDIAL campaign option)
- Ability to click-to-dial a phone number from a record in Vtiger screen to the vicidial.php screen
- Ability to click-to-dial from a Planned Activity record then have it changed to Held after VICIDIAL dispo
- Ability for an agent to click on a VC fax log or VC email log link to account for fax or email time through VICIDIAL
- Optional script to bulk load leads into Vtiger from a CSV file since Vtiger only seems to want to load 500 at a time: 
    Vtiger_IN_new_accounts_file.pl
- Batch Account synchronization through script to output new leads from Vtiger and update existing leads in the VICIDIAL system:
    Vtiger_OUT_sync2VICIDIAL_file.pl then you run the VICIDIAL_IN_new_leads_file.pl script to load the new leads


There has been a basic vtiger integration option available in VICIDIAL since the 1.X release versions through the vtiger_search.php web script(when used as a web form in the campaign) that will search through the leads for the dialed phone number in vicidial.php and if it is not in the vtiger system as a lead then it will be put in as a new lead.

More in-depth integration with Vtiger is a bit complicated due to the fact that it has 312 database tables to start with(and you though VICIDIAL had a lot with about 70). Attempts at using the built-in 5.0.4 API structure were unsuccessful because of inaccurate documentation and the inability to use the modules easily outside of the vtiger directory tree without major reworking of the vtiger code, so we decided to have VICIDIAL work directly with the database instead. Unfortunately, working only with the database doesn't get you the whole way with Vtiger. For user synchronization you need to make sure that the patch(Vtiger504_vicidial.patch) is applied to Vtiger(see instructions below). Part of this patch is used to create blank user profile files so Vtiger will load properly with synchronized users from VICIDIAL. Vtiger doesn't check to see if these user profile files exist before trying to use them, so one thing this patch does is check if the files exist for each user, and if they do not, it will create them with a simple placeholder. Another purpose of this patch is to allow for click-to-dial phone numbers in Vtiger, so that the numbers will be dialed as manual dial calls in a VICIDIAL agent screen. For this to work you must have applied the patch, you need to have user 1000 set up in VICIDIAL with a password of 1234 and Agent API set to '1', and the agent needs to be logged into vicidial.php(there is also a VICIDIAL Campaign Detail option to automatically login to Vtiger when an agent logs into vicidial.php, this can log the agent into Vtiger within the SCRIPT tab or by opening a new browser window) then when the agent clicks on any phone number with a "VCcall:" label next to it, a call will be placed in their vicidial.php agent screen and the Vtiger window will be closed(or left open if using alternate patch) so that they can open it up again with the vicidial.php WEB FORM button in VICIDIAL.

Since the 2.0.5 release we have added the ability to initiate a callback from a Planned Event screen that also will alter the event to Held status after the call is dispositioned.

as of 2008-12-31, several user synchronization features have been added to allow for the creation of vtiger users from the vicidial_users user database. The vtiger_search.php script has also been updated to work with the current vtiger release 5.0.4. To enable the Vtiger integration features you will need to go to the Admin -> System Settings section of the admin.php Administration web page to set Vtiger Integration to enabled and configure the connection details for the Vtiger database.

There are options in the VICIDIAL Modify Campaign Detail screen that you can choose how you want the vtiger_search.php to search for a Vtiger record in the Vtiger system. If Vtiger integration is enabled in the system_settings then this setting will define where the vtiger_search.php page will search for the phone number that was entered. There are 4 options that can be used in this field: 
	ACCTID- This option works only for accounts and it will take the vicidial vendor_lead_code field and try to search for the Vtiger accountid.     If unsuccessful it will try any other methods listed that you have selected. 
	ACCOUNT- This option will search through the Vtiger accounts and all contacts and sub-contacts for the phone number
	VENDOR- This option will only search through the Vtiger vendors
	LEAD- This option will search through the Vtiger leads only

    NOTE: For this to work, you must have the vtiger_search.php set as your webform page, i.e.(http://10.10.10.15/vicidial/vtiger_search.php) 
Multiple search options can be used for each campaign(in the VICIDIAL Campaign Detail screen), but on large databases this is not recommended. Default is LEAD. The order that you see the searching options above is the order in which they will be searched if you have selected multiple searching methods. If an account does not exist and you have LEAD selected as a search method, then(if the create lead option is enabled) it will insert the lead with that phone number and you will be taken to the edit screen for that lead when you go to the vtiger_search web page. There is also an option to log the call as an event in Vtiger that will associate with the Lead or Account that the agent screen is sent to. Vtiger recommends on standard equipment a limit of 50,000 account records, but many users report no issues with 100,000 or more account records in their Vtiger systems. 


Here are the procedures to load leads into Vtiger, then output them from Vtiger and then load them into VICIDIAL:
(the vicidial_list.vendor_lead_code field[=vtiger_accounts.accountid] is used as a key between systems)
- put properly formatted CSV file into /usr/share/astguiclient/VTIGER_IN/
- /usr/share/astguiclient/Vtiger_IN_new_accounts_file.pl --duplicate-system-website
- /usr/share/astguiclient/Vtiger_OUT_sync2VICIDIAL_file.pl --duplicate-system-vendor
- /usr/share/astguiclient/VICIDIAL_IN_new_leads_file.pl --forcelistid=9988

Then to keep the two systems in sync you would run the last two steps every day or at some other interval.


For VICIDIAL users that are synchronized to Vtiger, the following user_level to roles repationships are used:
- user_level 9 - H2, CEO
- user_level 8 - H3, Vice President
- user_level 7 - H4, Sales Manager
- user_level 6 and lower - H5, Sales Man


Here are the SQL queries used by the vtiger_search.php script to find records in the vtiger system:

ACCTID:
$stmt="SELECT count(*) from vtiger_account where accountid='$vendor_id';";

ACCOUNT:
$stmt="SELECT count(*) from vtiger_account where phone='$phone' or otherphone='$phone' or fax='$phone';";
$stmt="SELECT count(*) from vtiger_contactdetails where phone='$phone' or mobile='$phone' or fax='$phone';";
$stmt="SELECT count(*) from vtiger_contactsubdetails where homephone='$phone' or otherphone='$phone' or assistantphone='$phone';";

VENDOR:
$stmt="SELECT count(*) from vtiger_vendor where phone='$phone';";

LEAD:
$stmt="SELECT count(*) from vtiger_leadaddress where phone='$phone' or mobile='$phone' or fax='$phone';";





Here is a short summary of the needed steps to install vtiger on your system:

NOTE: vtiger requires PHP5, APACHE2.2 and MySQL5, 
      see the REQUIRED_APPS.txt doc for install instructions for those packages


mysql
GRANT ALL on vtigercrm510.* TO vtiger@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'vtuser';
GRANT ALL on vtigercrm510.* TO vtiger@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'vtuser';
create database vtigercrm510;
quit

cd /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/
wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/vtigercrm/files/vtiger%20CRM%205.1.0/vtigercrm-5.1.0.tar.gz
tar xvfz vtigercrm-5.1.0.tar.gz
chmod -R 0777 vtigercrm
cd vtigercrm
ls -l
* in browser go to the following URL: http://ip-address/vtigetcrm/index.php
* enter contact info and click the START button at the bottom of the screen
* in system configuration set the database host to: <ip-address>
* database user/pass: vtiger/vtuser
* database name: vtigercrm510
* change default admin(vtadmin) and standarduser(vtuser) passwords
* click to install vtiger, then follow the on-screen instructions
# patch vtiger to fix issue with user synchronization and add click-to-dial:
cp /usr/src/astguiclient/trunk/extras/Vtiger510_vicidial_001_noclose.patch ./
patch -p1 < ./Vtiger510_vicidial_001_noclose.patch


To link specific Vtiger Roles to ViciDial user levels, you need to find the Vtiger user Role code "H5, H4, etc..." and then run these MySQL queries to set the relationship:
INSERT INTO vtiger_vicidial_roles SET user_level='1',vtiger_role='H5';
INSERT INTO vtiger_vicidial_roles SET user_level='2',vtiger_role='H5';
INSERT INTO vtiger_vicidial_roles SET user_level='3',vtiger_role='H5';
INSERT INTO vtiger_vicidial_roles SET user_level='4',vtiger_role='H5';
INSERT INTO vtiger_vicidial_roles SET user_level='5',vtiger_role='H5';
INSERT INTO vtiger_vicidial_roles SET user_level='6',vtiger_role='H5';
INSERT INTO vtiger_vicidial_roles SET user_level='7',vtiger_role='H4';
INSERT INTO vtiger_vicidial_roles SET user_level='8',vtiger_role='H3';
INSERT INTO vtiger_vicidial_roles SET user_level='9',vtiger_role='H2';


Now to explain the database side of things. 
First, here is how users are stored in vtiger:

THE USER TABLES:
vtiger_users
vtiger_user2role
vtiger_users2group
vtiger_users_last_import
vtiger_users_seq
vtiger_usertype


TABLE DETAIL:

The vtiger_users table has the basic user information for users fo the vtiger system. An agent must have an entry in this table to be able to access the vtigers system. user_name is the field that is synchronized with the vicidial_users.user field in VICIDIAL.
