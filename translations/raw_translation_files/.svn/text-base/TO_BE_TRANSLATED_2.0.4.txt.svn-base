The VICIDIAL basic web-based lead loader is designed simply to take a lead file - up to 8MB in size - that is either tab or pipe delimited and load it into the vicidial_list table. The lead loader allows for field choosing and TXT- Plain Text, CSV- Comma Separated Values and XLS- Excel file formats. The lead loader does not do data validation, but it does allow you to check for duplicates in itself, within the campaign or within the entire system. Also, make sure that you have created the list that these leads are to be under so that you can use them. Here is a list of the fields in their proper order for the lead files:||
NOTES: The Excel Lead loader functionality is enabled by a series of perl scripts and needs to have a properly configured /etc/astguiclient.conf file in place on the web server. Also, a couple perl modules must be loaded for it to work as well - OLE-Storage_Lite and Spreadsheet-ParseExcel. You can check for runtime errors in these by looking at your apache error_log file. Also, for duplication checks against gampaign lists, the list that has new leads going into it does need to be created in the system before you start to load the leads.||
