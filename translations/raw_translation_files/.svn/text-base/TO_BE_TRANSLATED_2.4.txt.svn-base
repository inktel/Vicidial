Add A Dial Status to Call||
Admin Modify Auto-Refresh||
This is the refresh interval in seconds of the modify screens in this admin interface. Setting this to 0 will disable it, setting it below 5 will mostly make the modify screens unusable because they will refresh too quickly to change fields. This option is useful in situations where more than one manager is controlling settings on an active campaign or in-group so that the settings are refreshed frequently. Default is 0||
Admin No-Cache||
Setting this to 1 will set all admin pages to web browser no-cache, so every screen has to be reloaded every time it is viewed, even if clicking back on the browser. Default is 0 for disabled||
Generate Cross-Server Phone Extensions||

Automatic Hopper Level||
Setting thing to Y will allow Vicidial to automatically adjust the hopper based off the settings you have in your campaign.  The formula it uses to do this is||
Automatic Hopper Multiplier||
This is multiplier for the Auto Hopper. Setting this less than 1 will cause the Auto Hopper algorithm to load less leads than it normally would.  Setting this greater than 1 will cause the Auto Hopper algorithm to load more leads than it normally would.  Default is 1||
Auto Trim Hopper||
Setting thing to Y will allow Vicidial to automatically remove excess leads from the hopper. Default is Y||
Manual Dial API||
This option allows you to set the Agent API to make either one call at a time, STANDARD, or the ability to queue up manual dial calls and have them dial automatically once the agent goes on pause or is available to take their next call with the option to disable the automatic dialing of these calls, QUEUE, or QUEUE_AND_AUTOCALL which is the same as QUEUE but without the option to disable the automatic dialing of these calls. If an agent has more than one call queued up for them they will see the count of how many manual dial calls are in queue right below the Pause button, or Dial Next Number button. We suggest that if QUEUE is used that you send API actions using the preview=YES option so you are not repeatedly dialing calls for the agent without notice. Also, if using QUEUE and heavily using manual dial calls in a non MANUAL dial method, we would recommend setting the Agent Pause After Each Call option to Y. Default is STANDARD||
Manual Call Time Check||
If this option is enabled, it will check all manual dial calls to make sure they are within the call time settings set for the campaign. Default is DISABLED||
If you want to change this lead to a scheduled callback, first change the Disposition to CBHOLD, then submit and you will be able to set the callback date and time||

For Example: for the SIP phone SIP/test101 the Phone extension would be test101. Also, for IAX2 phones: IAX2/IAXphone1@IAXphone1 would be IAXphone1. For Zap and Dahdi attached channelbank or FXS phones make sure you put the full channel number without the prefix: Zap/25-1 would be 25-1.  Another note, make sure you set the Protocol field below correctly for your type of phone||

For instance, the List Order will be used for the first sort of the leads, but the results will be sorted a second time within that sorting across the same set of the first List Order. For example, if you have List Order set to DOWN COUNT and you only have leads that have been attempted 1 and 2 times, then if you have the List Order Secondary set to LEAD_ASCEND all of the attempt 1 leads will be sorted by the oldest leads first and will be put into the hopper that way. Default is LEAD_ASCEND. NOTE, if you have a large number of leads using one of the CALLTIME options may slow down the speed of the hopper loading script||
My Callbacks Checkbox Default||
This option allows you to pre-set the My Callback checkbox on the agent scheduled callback screen. CHECKED will check the checkbox automatically for every call. Default is UNCHECKED||

NOTES: For ring_all, the agents that are using phones that have On Hook Agent enabled will have their phones ring and the first one to answer will receive the call and the information on the agent screen. Since ring_all ignores agent wait time and ranking and will call every agent that is available for the queue, we do not recommend using this method for large queues. When using ring_all, agents logged with phones that have the On Hook Agent disabled will have to use the Calls In Queue panel and click on the TAKE CALL link to take calls in queue. The amount of time the agents phone will ring for ring_all is set to the On-Hook Ring Time setting or the shortest ring time of the phones that will be called. We do not recommend using ring_all on high call volume queues, or queues with many agents. The ring_all method is intended to be used with only a few agents and on low call volume in-groups||
This option is only used for agents that are logged in with phones that have the agent-on-hook feature enabled. This is the number of seconds that each call attempt to the agent will ring for until the system will wait one second and start ringing the available agent phones again. This field can be overridden if the agent phones are set to a lower ring time which may be necessary to prevent calls from being sent one phones voicemail. Default is 15||

This is the number of seconds that each call attempt will ring to try to get an answer. It is recommended that you set this to a few seconds less than it takes for a call to be sent to voicemail. Default is 15||
On-Hook Agent Login||
This option is only used for inbound calls going to an agent logged in with this phone. This feature will call the agent and will not send the customer to the agents session until the line is answered. Default is N for disabled||

This option will disable some options on the Modify Campaign screen and show a link to the Multi-Alt Settings page which allows you to set which phone number types, defined by the label of each lead, will be dialed and in what order. This will create a special lead filter and will alter the Rank field of all of the leads inside the lists set to this campaign in order to call them in the order you have specified||
Manual Dial CID||
This defines whether an agent making manual dial calls will have the campaign callerID settings used, or their agent phone callerID settings used. Default is CAMPAIGN||
If the Use Custom CID campaign option is enabled or the list Campaign CID Override setting is used, this setting will be ignored||
Phone Post Time Difference Alert||
This manual-dial-only feature, if enabled, will display an alert if the time zone for the lead postal code, or zip code, is different from the time zone of the area code of the phone number for the lead. The OUTSIDE_CALLTIME_ONLY option will only show the alert if the two time zones are different and one of the time zones is outside of the call time selected for the campaign.

If the number of agents falls below the number that you have set, then the dial level will go to 1.0 until more agents log in or go into the selected state. LOGGED-IN_AGENTS will count all agents logged into the campaign, NON-PAUSED_AGENTS will only count agents that are waiting or talking, and WAITING_AGENTS will only count agents that are waiting for a call. Default is DISABLED||
Available Only Tally Threshold||
This setting only works with an ADAPT or RATIO Dial Method, Available Only Tally must be set to N, this setting must be set to something other than DISABLED and the number of agents setting must be above 0.
